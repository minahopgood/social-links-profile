## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Keyboard accessibility
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After my previous two challenges, I spent some time learning how to use em and rem units and I feel as though I have finally have a grasp on how to use them. I also did some research into focus states, as I wasn't sure what the difference was between :hover and :focus. I have learned how to properly customise a website to not only make it pretty, but to help with basic keyboard accessibility.


### Continued development

I will be trying to incorporate more website accessibility into my code. Early on in my web development journey I touched on this subject through freeCodeCamp, but now that I have a better grasp on the basics of HTML and CSS, I think I will have a better time understanding these concepts and how to use them.

### Useful resources

- [A Guide To Keyboard Accessibility - Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/11/guide-keyboard-accessibility-html-css-part1/) - I used this website to assist with learning about focus states and keyboard accessibility. It seems to be an extremely thorough resource that I will be refering back to in the future.
- [The Difference Between em and rem units - Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) - This was recommended to me by another Frontend Mentor member to help with learning the difference between em and rem units. It was incredibly helpful and I feel like I have a much stronger grasp on how to use them.
